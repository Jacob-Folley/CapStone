#Tsundoku
A website that starts with four main types: __Movies__ / __Series__ / __Anime__ / __Books__. The user can choose a category and see a list of each category. The user can filter by different categories and can specifically search by name. The user can view information about media and can add to their own list. The user will also be able to write a review and rate the show/book if they want. 

##Motivation
This application will solve searching for all different types of media by putting it all in one place and organizing a personal list in one application for the user.

##Technologies:
- React
- HTML
- CSS

##For site to work properly:
1. Use [CapStone-API Repository](https://github.com/Jacob-Folley/CapStone-API) 
2. Run: `json-server -p 8088 database.json` on API Directory in terminal
3. Run: `json-server -p 8788 data.json` on API Directory in terminal
3. Run: `npm start` on CapStone-client

Books section has no seed data and Movies and Television has limited. To get the most functionality use the Anime section.
